Our packaging is specially made to cater to each individual item. They are rigorously tested to ensure they can withstand most kinds of incidences in transportation. Any self-packed items by the customer will have a high chance of being damaged on the way caused by flimsy materials or improper techniques. That’s why we don’t generally allow any returns without their complete original packaging. In a way, this also prevents lots of potentially wasted efforts and protects the customer’s interest.<\/p>",
